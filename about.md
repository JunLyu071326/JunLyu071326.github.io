I am a third-year Ph.D student interested in Syntax, Computational Linguistics and Chinese dialects. Currently, I am working on topic structure in Mandarin Chinese and Wh-scope in Mandarin and Korean. Additionally, I am studying scrambling and its relationship with other freedom of word-order phenomena in world languages.
